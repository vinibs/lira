        <h2 id="installingandupdating">Installing and updating</h2>
        <p>
            Lira can be downloaded from its 
            <a href="https://github.com/vinibs/lira" target="_blank">
            GitHub page</a>, cloning the project or getting a 
            <b>.zip</b> file with all its structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            To install and run it, just put the project files in the
            root directory of your web server.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
            To update the framework, the simplest way to do this is
            downloading and replacing the <b>js/lira.js</b> file on
            your server.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, you should be aware if the new version doesn't 
            change the project's 
            <a href="#basicstructure">basic structure</a>. The current
            version, for example, isn't compatible with v1.0 of Lira,
            as it was completely rewritten using a different approach.
        </p>


        <br/><br/>

        <h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
        <p>
            Lira's structure isn't too big or too complex. 
            Nevertheless, some files must be in the correct directory
            in order to get everything running correctly.
            The minimum file structure needed to run it is as follows:
        </p>

        <span class="dirtree">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    /
                    <i class="grayfont" style="font-weight: lighter;">
                        (app root)
                    </i>
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        js
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="treefile">lira.js</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>
                        src
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            config
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                            <li class="treefile">config.js</li>
                            <li class="treefile">routes.js</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>

                    <li class="treefile">
                        index.html
                    </li>
                    <li class="treefile">
                        <i>manifest.json</i>
                        <i class="comment">
                            &nbsp;// Only needed if using PWA
                        </i>
                    </li>
                    <li class="treefile">
                        robots.txt
                    </li>
                    <li class="treefile">
                        <i>service_worker.json</i>
                        <i class="comment">
                            &nbsp;// Only needed if using PWA
                        </i>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </span>

        <p>
            Although the minimum files needed to run the framework are few,
            the default download comes with some other files that may serve
            as examples of its inner components' organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some recommendations about the structure are to always use
            the <b>/src</b> directory to store your web components and
            to separate reusable components (in a directory like
            <b>/src/components</b>) from the pages' main files (in a 
            folder like <b>/src/view</b>). The
            <a href="https://github.com/vinibs/lira" target="_blank">
            project's repository</a> shows a structure that is based
            on these recomendations.
        </p>


        <br/><br/>

        <h2 id="basicoperation">Basic operation</h2>
        <p>
            Lira has a relatively simple operation, based on Google's
            documentation for <a target="_blank" href=
            "https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements">
            web components custom elements</a>. Each component file is 
            also the responsible to initialize itself so its custom tag
            becomes available to be attached to the DOM. Therefore, the
            file just need to be imported by a currently running script.
        </p>
        <p>
            Different from the last version, which used the concept of
            "lazy loading" to get pages' data, the current version loads
            the contents of all files used in the website or application at
            once, so the first page load is slower than the next ones, but
            the access to the contents of the other pages is faster than
            loading each one every time it's needed. This also allows the
            entire app to be cached by the browser so it doesn't need to
            download all its contents every time a user accesses the 
            application. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This version also brings support for <b>PWAs</b> 
            (Progressive Web Apps), as <a target="_blank"
            href="https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/">documented 
            here</a>, by default. That means that a new Lira app is
            also a basic PWA without extra efforts. This configuration,
            on the other hand, is optional and a Lira app can also be
            just a website, without prompting users for installation on
            their phones or desktops, with few steps to get there.
        </p>
        <p>
            To put all these concepts together, Lira uses its route 
            definition file (<b>routes.js</b>) as a "glue" of the 
            main components, the basic HTML and its routing system.
            The <a href="#routes">routes</a> section brings more 
            information about using this part of Lira.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its routing system also uses a slash to isolate the hash
            character in the URL, so when a path like 
            <b><i>yourapp/#users</i></b> is accessed, it is automatically 
            changed to <b><i>yourapp/#/users</i></b>. Lira does this 
            to make it more readable and handles the current URL so 
            the routes doesn't need to specify the slash separator.
        </p>


        <br/><br/>

        <h2 id="initialsetup">Initial setup</h2>
        <p>
            This Lira version was made thinking in reduce the initial setup
            needed for running the framework, so it doesn't require a first
            configuration to be ready. This is thanks to the use of the hash
            based <a href="#routes">routing</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            With this new format, Lira should work in any web server without
            needing too many adjusts like redirecting all requests to the
            same HTML file.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, there is a configuration file (<b>config/config.js</b>)
            that stores a JSON with configurable properties. However, its current 
            only property tells about using Lira to work as a PWA as described 
            below in the <a href="#notusingpwa">not using PWA</a> section.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <h3 id="notusingpwa">Not using PWA</h3>
        <p>
            Now, by default, Lira comes configured to behave as a <b>Progressive
            Web App (PWA)</b>. This means that an website or webapp built with 
            Lira <a href="https://web.dev/progressive-web-apps/" 
            target="_blank">can also be installed</a> on smartphones and desktops.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, this is optional and to use Lira without the PWA resources
            there are a few things that need to be done:
            <ul>
                <li>Delete the <b>manifest.json</b> file,</li>
                <li>
                    Set the <b>pwa-enabled</b> entry of the 
                    <b>config/config.js</b> file to <i>false</i> (this will stop
                    Lira from trying to load the <i>service_worker.js</i> file),
                </li>
                <li>Delete the <b>service_worker.js</b> file,</li>
                <li>
                    Delete the <b>images/icons</b> directory (if it already 
                    exists in your project),
                </li>
                <li>
                    Remove the references to the manifest's and the icons' files
                    from the <b>index.html</b> file.
                </li>
            </ul>
            After these steps, yout Lira website should behave as just a browser's
            web app, not as a PWA anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            And, if you want to get the PWA behavior back, just restore the files
            and files' references and set the config property again to <i>true</i>. 
            Basically, undo the list above.
        </p>


        <br/><br/>

        <h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>
        <p>
            To give freedom to the developer and try to make some things a
            little easier, Lira offers a few modules that integrate its 
            inner components.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <h3 id="routemodule">Route module</h3>
        <p>
            The route module is an instance of Lira's Route class. It 
            currently offers only the <b>set()</b> method, which should 
            be used to define an app route.
        </p>
        <p>
            To import this module, use the default JS <b>import</b>
            syntax, referencing the <b>lira.js</b> file.
        </p>

        <div class="pregroup">
            <pre><i class="comment">Importing the <b>route</b> module</i></pre>
            <pre>import { <b>route</b> } from <b>'../../js/lira.js'</b></pre>
        </div>


        <h4 id="routesetmethod">Method: set()</h4>
        <p>
            As documented in the <a href="#routes">routes section</a>,
            the set() method expects two parameters: a <b>string as
            the route path</b> and a <b>string or a function as the
            component to be called</b> when the route path is achieved
            by a user.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <h3 id="httpmodule">HTTP module</h3>
        <p>
            To help handling some properties of the requests made to the
            website or app, Lira has a little HTTP module. It currently
            has two properties and one method available.
        </p>

        <div class="pregroup">
            <pre><i class="comment">Importing the <b>http</b> module</i></pre>
            <pre>import { <b>http</b> } from <b>'../../js/lira.js'</b></pre>
        </div>

        <h4 id="httpparamsprop">Property: params</h4>
        <p>
            Lira's HTTP module stores the parameters obtained when the app
            receives a request to a URL that uses a 
            <a href="#paramroute">param route</a>. This attribute is set 
            automatically and can be accessed directly, but it can also be 
            overridden.
        </p>
        
        <div class="pregroup">
            <pre>let params = http.params <i class="comment"
                >// Gets the current request's parameters</i></pre>
            <pre>http.params = { "id": 12 } <i class="comment"
                >// Sets the value of HTTP's params to a new object</i></pre>
        </div>

        <h4 id="httpappmodeprop">Property: appMode</h4>
        <p>
            This property gets the current mode the app is running. Its value
            can be <b>browser</b>, <b>standalone</b>, <b>minimal-ui</b> or
            <b>fullscreen</b>. This value is set using the <b>CSS media 
            attribute</b> to inform how the app is being accessed currently.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the website or application is accessed through the browser,
            the property will return the value "browser". If the browser is
            running in full screen mode, it can return "fullscreen". This
            value also can be returned if the user install the PWA and it is
            configured to open in full screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the full screen mode, if the PWA is installed, depending on its
            configuration, this property can return "standalone" when the app 
            is running on its own window, or "minimal-ui" if running in its own
            window with a few navigation buttons on its UI.
        </p>

        <div class="pregroup">
            <pre>let currentMode = http.appMode <i class="comment"
                >// Gets the mode used by the user to access the app</i></pre>
        </div>

        <h4 id="httplistenforappmodemethod">Method: listenForAppMode()</h4>
        <p>
            Sometimes is needed to make the app listen to changes in the mode
            its been viewed (like when the user just installed it on a desktop
            browser). To help with this, there is the listenForAppMode method.
        </p>
        <p>
            It receives a <b>string as the first parameter</b>, which defines
            the app mode needs to be listened. The second parameter this method
            receives is <b>the callback function</b> to be executed when the 
            desired app mode is used to view the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            This method adds a listener for the change of the app mode 
            property (the <b>CSS display-mode property</b>) and runs the
            callback when the property changes to the desired value. This 
            method always passes the <b>event</b> parameter to the callback.
        </p>

        <div class="pregroup">
            <pre><b>http.listenForAppMode</b>('standalone', (e) => {</pre>
            <pre>   this.innerHTML = this.render()  <i class="comment"
                >// Re-renders when appMode changes to 'standalone'</i></pre>
            <pre>})</pre>
        </div>


        <br/><br/>

        <h2 id="routes">Routes</h2>
        <p>
            The heart of Lira is its routing system, that now uses the hash
            based routing instead of using the location API it used in the
            first version.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although this mechanism doesn't give as beautiful result as does
            the location API, separating the resources from the website domain
            with a hash (#) currently gives the best isolation between the
            server configurations and the front-end.

        <h3 id="routedefinition">Route definition</h3>
        <p>
            Routes can be defined importing the <b>route</b> module. It is an
            object, a class instance, exported by the <b>js/lira.js</b> file 
            and has a <i><b>set()</b></i> method, which should be used to 
            declare routes within Lira.
        </p>
        <p>
            This <b>route.set()</b> method expects 2 parameters: the route 
            <u>path</u> and the <u>component</u> that will be rendered when the
            given path is accessed by the users.
        </p>
        <p>
            When defining a route to a custom element, <b>the routes.js file
            must contain the imports of those components that will be used
            by a route</b>. These imports must be in de beginning of the file 
            in order to work correctly and the imports need to refer the whole 
            JS component's file (not like importing an exported module) and must 
            include its file extension.
        </p>

        <p>
            The <b>path</b> param is a string that defines the right part of
            the hash in URL that users will access. This path can be a string
            that needs to correspond <b>exactly</b> to the accessed URL, a 
            string that indicates a <b>parameterized resource</b>, as can be 
            seen in the <a href="#paramroute">param route</a> section, or a 
            <b>wildcard</b> character to receive all routes that doesn't fit 
            any of the other defined rules. The route's path may start with 
            or without a slash.
        </p>

        </span>
        
        <p>
            The <b>component</b> param is a string that defines the name of
            the custom element's tag to be used for the path or a function 
            that should execute when the URL is reached. If the component
            is a function, nothing will be rendered on the browser unless the
            component tells the browser to do this, as calling some 
            <i>element.innerHTML = {content}</i> inside the function.
        </p>
        <p>
            Its important to keep in mind that to define a route to a custom
            element component, its JS file needs to be imported before setting
            the route to it, so the browser knows <i>"who is this custom 
            tag"</i>.

            <b>Note:</b> keep in mind that the <b>path</b> parameter, when
            defines with an empty string (<b>""</b>), means the same as being
            set to the application root path (<b>"/"</b>). Both params are
            needed to define a route.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <h3 id="paramroute">Param route</h3>
        <p>
            Lira also supports parameterized routes. This means that users
            can pass values for the application directly within the route.
            With this, a route defined with a parameter, let's call it "id",
            can receive any value in the "id" position of the URL and use it
            inside the rendered component.
        </p>
        <p>
            The parameter is set using the syntax <b>{param_name}</b> inside
            the route path string, while setting a route, where 
            <b>"param_name"</b> means the key that will be given to the 
            value that come from the URL, in a key-value pair.
        </p>

        <div class="pregroup">
            <pre><b class="comment"
                >Given the URL: <i>yourapp.com/#/user/7</i></b></pre>
            <pre><b>route.set(</b>'user/{id}', 'user-page')</pre>
            <pre><i class="comment"
                >Will result in { "id" : 7 }</i></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            But how to get the route's parameter value? Getting the
            <b>params</b> attribute from Lira's 
            <a href="#httpmodule">HTTP module instance</a>. So, 
            continuing the example above, for tha same URL, the component 
            needs to do as follows:
        </p>

        <div class="pregroup">
            <pre><b class="comment"
                >Given the URL: <i>yourapp.com/#/user/7</i></b></pre>
            <pre><b class="comment"
                >And the route path: <i>user/{id}</i></b></pre>
            <pre>import { <b>http</b> } from <b>'../../../js/lira.js'</b></pre>
            <pre></pre>
            <pre>class CustomElement <i>extends HTMLElement</i> {</pre>
            <pre>   someMethod () {</pre>
            <pre>       let pageParams = <b>http.params</b></pre>
            <pre>       <i class="comment"
                            >So the <b>pageParams</b> variable receives: <b
                            >{ "id" : 7 }</b></i></pre>
            <pre>   }</pre>
            <pre>}</pre>
        </div>

        <br/><br/>

        <h2 id="components">Components</h2>
        <p>
            Lira's components use the <a target="_blank" href=
            "https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements">web component's custom elements standard</a>,
            so a component is <b>a JS class that extends HTMLElement</b> 
            (or other, more specific, HTML element) and defines a custom
            HTML tag, whose name must contain a hyphen.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, components have a <b>render()</b> method (to be 
            a little similar to React), but they doesn't need to. All the
            component's life cycle is defined within the own class. Anyway,
            having a method that just returns the element's inner HTML could
            be helpful to organize things.
        </p>
        <p>
            As documented by Google, custom elements have their own life
            cycle methods, and they are also useful in Lira. So, using
            the constructor to initialize properties of the component or
            using the <b>connectedCallback()</b> method to set its inner
            content when it is attached to de DOM are also helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, Lira has two specificities whem the matter is its
            components: <b>the classes' files must declare its own
            custom HTML tags</b> and <b>every class that uses another
            component's custom tag should import it by itself</b>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This means that a component's file has its class, its custom 
            tag definition and the imports to every other component that
            is used by its HTML. Because of that, its needed to import
            all the file (which already runs the custom tag definition),
            instead of importing an exported component from the file.
        </p>
        <p>
            To define a component, an order must be follow in order to 
            everything work as espected: first, de file need to run 
            <b>all its imports</b>. Then, the <b>component's class</b> must 
            be defined. At last, at the end of the file, outside the class
            or any function, the <b>element's custom tag</b> must be defined.
        </p>

        <div class="pregroup">
            <pre><b class="comment">Example of HomePage's component file</b></pre>
            <pre>import '../components/main-menu.js' <i class="comment"
                >// Imports the whole file (with the <b>.js</b> extension</i></pre>
            <pre></pre>
            <pre>class HomePage <i>extends HTMLElement</i> { <i class="comment"
                >// Defines the class, extending HTMLElement</i></pre>
            <pre>   ... </pre>
            <pre>}</pre>
            <pre></pre>
            <pre>window.customElements.define('home-page', HomePage) <i 
                class="comment">// Defines the component's custom tag</i></pre>
        </div>

        <p>
            This order is simple to understand: the custom tag definition
            expects the class to already be known, and the class expects
            the other components it uses to be known as well. So, first
            things first in component creation.
